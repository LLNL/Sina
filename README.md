Sina provides an API and command line interface for organizing, accessing,
querying, and visualizing data stored using a supported schema. It's intended
to be used especially with run metadata, allowing users to easily and efficiently
find simulation runs that match some criteria.

Sina's code comes in two parts. The "cpp" component is an API for use in C++ codes that allows
them to write data in Sina's recognized format. The remainder of Sina is found in
the "python" directory, and includes all the functionality for handling and
ingesting data, visualizing it through Jupyter, etc.

Please see the READMEs included in those folders for more information on each
component. If you have any questions, you can contact us at siboka@llnl.gov
