Using the Examples
==================

Sina's tutorials mostly consist of Jupyter notebooks. You can access
pre-run versions of them as part of the documentation.

To run them yourself, you'll need to run `getting_started.ipynb` or
else manually create a Jupyter kernel. From there, `basic_usage.ipynb`
covers most basic Sina functionality.
