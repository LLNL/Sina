    "Sina's job is making managing simulation data easier, so we try to keep the process simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sina's \"unit of data\"--the thing you store, retrieve, and ask questions about--is a `Record`. To be brief, **one simulation run is one Record** (but the word Record is more source-agnostic). Essentially, a `Record` is a set of inputs and their corresponding outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **You can work with** `Records` **individually.** Sina gives you a Python object with some nice quality of life methods for post-processing, but under the hood, that Python object is functionally the same JSON your simulation code may be dumping out (they tend to be named `*_sina.json`). Another way of putting it is that **Sina turns your simulation runs into simple Python objects that can be manipulated according to your post-processing needs**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Much of Sina's API is dedicated to looking at** `Records` **in aggregate**. Say you've done dozens/hundreds/millions of runs and you want to pick the interesting ones. Sina's API contains a series of \"questions\" you can ask. Which runs had the highest `etot`? Which ended within 300 `cycle`s? Which had `laser_package` turned on and `debug` off?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **A big part of Sina is using these capabilities in tandem**. Use the \"questioning\" part of the API to narrow down which runs you want to look at, then use the returned objects to take a closer look. For example, you get all the runs where `max_temp` went above some number, then use the objects to re-launch with slightly different settings."
