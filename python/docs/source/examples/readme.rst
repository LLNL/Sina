Running Examples Locally
++++++++++++++++++++++++

Our hands-on tutorials consist largely of Jupyter notebooks. To run them locally,
you'll want to get the Jupyter requirements installed (see the `README <../README.html>`__),
then navigate to the ``<sina_root>/examples/`` folder, run ``jupyter notebook``,
open ``getting_started.ipynb``, and run the cells inside to get Jupyter set up.

If you're an LC user working with Sina on the machines, you can also use LLNL's
`Jupyter instance <https://lc.llnl.gov/jupyter>`_. Using Sina with LLNL's Jupyter
will enable you to load data directly from the filesystem.
